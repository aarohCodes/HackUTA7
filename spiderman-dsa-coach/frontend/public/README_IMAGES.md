# Custom Spider-Man Mascot Images

To use your custom Spider-Man mascot images, place them in this directory (`frontend/public/`) with these exact names:

## Required Images:
- `standard_pose.png` - The normal/default pose of your Spider-Man mascot
- `speaking_pose.png` - The speaking/active pose when giving feedback

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Recommended 80x80 pixels or larger (will be scaled to fit)
- **Background**: Must be transparent
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## How It Works:
- **Standard pose**: Shows when Spider-Man is idle (not speaking)
- **Speaking pose**: Shows when Spider-Man is giving feedback or in the dialog
- **Transparent background**: Preserved automatically
- **Drop shadow**: Added via CSS for better visual appeal

## File Structure:
```
frontend/public/
├── standard_pose.png    ← Your normal pose image
├── speaking_pose.png    ← Your speaking pose image
└── spiderman-icon.svg   ← Browser tab icon (optional)
```

Once you add these images, your custom Spider-Man mascot will automatically appear in the app! 🕸️
